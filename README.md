## only neovim config files written in lua for now.
Did not get the splash screen working yet.

My main areas of focus for this neovim setup are:
* Lua for neovim
* Swift for Vapor, also worth a look: https://github.com/kkharji/xbase
* XML / XSLT for CoreData aka xcdatamodel, Storyboard / XIB / NIB, EHF, and UBL
* Rust for Yew and RataTUI
* JSON for UI

Install Packer
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Eventually this repo will contain more stuff; in this case you may or may not desire to pull one or more folders specifically. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/600079/how-do-i-clone-a-subdirectory-only-of-a-git-repository
