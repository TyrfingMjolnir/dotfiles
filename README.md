## only neovim config files written in lua for now.
Did not get the splash screen working yet.

My main areas of focus for this neovim setup are:
* Lua for neovim
* Swift for Vapor, also worth a look: https://github.com/kkharji/xbase
* XML / XSLT for CoreData aka xcdatamodel, Storyboard / XIB / NIB, EHF, and UBL
* Rust for Yew and RataTUI
* JSON for UI
